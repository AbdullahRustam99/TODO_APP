# Feature Specification: Phase I - Console TODO App

**Feature Branch**: `001-phase1-console-todo`
**Created**: 2025-12-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Create the detailed specification for Phase I of the AI TODO APP project. The system is an in-memory Python console-based TODO application developed using Spec-Driven Development. All code must be generated by Claude Code. Manual coding is not allowed."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.

  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - Basic Task Management (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to add, view, and manage my tasks through a console interface so that I can organize my work efficiently.

**Why this priority**: This provides the core functionality that makes the application useful - users need to be able to create and see their tasks.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by adding tasks, viewing them, and confirming they persist in memory during the session.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the application is running, **When** I enter "add" command with a task title, **Then** the task is added with a unique ID and shown as incomplete
2. **Given** I have added tasks, **When** I enter "view" command, **Then** all tasks are displayed with their ID, title, description, and status
3. **Given** I have added tasks, **When** I enter "help" command, **Then** available commands are displayed

---

### User Story 2 - Task Modification (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want to update and delete my tasks so that I can maintain accurate information about my work.

**Why this priority**: After basic creation/viewing, users need to be able to modify existing tasks to keep their todo list current.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by adding tasks, modifying them, and verifying the changes persist in memory.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have added tasks, **When** I enter "update" command with a valid task ID and new information, **Then** the task is updated accordingly
2. **Given** I have added tasks, **When** I enter "delete" command with a valid task ID, **Then** the task is removed from the list
3. **Given** I have tasks with different statuses, **When** I enter "mark complete" command with a valid task ID, **Then** the task status changes to complete

---

### User Story 3 - Application Lifecycle (Priority: P3)

As a user, I want to gracefully exit the application so that I can close the program when I'm done.

**Why this priority**: Provides a clean way for users to exit the application without errors.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by starting the application and using the exit command to terminate it properly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the application is running, **When** I enter "exit" command, **Then** the application terminates gracefully
2. **Given** the application is running, **When** I enter invalid commands, **Then** appropriate error messages are shown without crashing the app

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.
-->

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to add tasks with a title and optional description
- **FR-002**: System MUST assign a unique numeric ID to each task automatically (1, 2, 3, etc.)
- **FR-003**: System MUST store tasks in memory using Python data structures only during the session (data lost when app exits)
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow users to view all tasks with ID, title, description, and completion status
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow users to update task title and/or description by ID
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow users to delete tasks by ID
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow users to mark tasks with three-state status: pending, in_progress, done
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide simple text commands: "add", "view", "update", "delete", "mark", "help", "exit"
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide an exit command to gracefully terminate the application
- **FR-010**: System MUST validate user input and handle invalid commands gracefully
- **FR-011**: System MUST default all new tasks to "pending" status
- **FR-012**: System MUST display user-friendly error messages with guidance for invalid operations

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Task**: Represents a single todo item with id (integer), title (string), description (string), status (enum: pending, in_progress, done), created_at (timestamp)
- **TaskManager**: Manages the collection of tasks in memory, provides CRUD operations for tasks
- **ConsoleInterface**: Handles user input/output, command parsing, and user interaction

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can successfully add, view, update, delete, and mark tasks as complete using console commands
- **SC-002**: All commands execute without crashing the application under normal usage conditions
- **SC-003**: The application provides clear feedback for both successful operations and errors
- **SC-004**: Task data persists in memory during the application session and is managed correctly
- **SC-005**: The application follows clean Python coding standards and project structure
- **SC-006**: All user stories can be demonstrated independently with the core functionality working as specified

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-12-27

- Q: What task status enum should be used? → A: Use "pending", "in_progress", "done" (three-state)
- Q: What command format should be used? → A: Simple text commands: "add", "view", "update", "delete", "mark", "help", "exit"
- Q: How should errors be handled? → A: User-friendly error messages with guidance
- Q: What ID format should be used? → A: Auto-generated numeric IDs (1, 2, 3, etc.)
- Q: What persistence approach should be used? → A: In-memory only during session (data lost when app exits)
