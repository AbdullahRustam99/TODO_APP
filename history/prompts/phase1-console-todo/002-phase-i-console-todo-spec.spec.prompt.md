## Prompt

```
Create the detailed specification for Phase I of the "AI TODO APP" project.

The system is an in-memory Python console-based TODO application developed using Spec-Driven Development. All code must be generated by Claude Code. Manual coding is not allowed.

The application must support the following features:
1. Add Task – add a task with title and description
2. Delete Task – delete a task by unique ID
3. Update Task – update task title and/or description
4. View Tasks – list all tasks with ID, title, description, and completion status
5. Mark Complete – mark tasks as complete or incomplete
6. Help – display available commands
7. Exit – gracefully exit the application

Functional requirements:
- Tasks are stored in memory only
- Each task has a unique ID
- Default task status is incomplete
- Input validation and graceful error handling

Non-functional requirements:
- Clean and readable Python code
- Simple and user-friendly console interaction
- use library for desig the terminal todo app
- Deterministic behavior
- Proper Python project structure

Technology constraints:
- Python 3.13+
- Use UV for environment management
- Use Claude Code for all code generation
- Follow Spec-Kit Plus workflow

Output expectations:
- Define task data model
- Define command behavior and input/output
- Define user interaction flow
- Define error handling rules
- Define success criteria for Phase I
```

## Response snapshot

Created detailed specification for Phase I - Console TODO App at specs/phase1-console-todo/spec.md. The specification includes:

- Three prioritized user stories covering basic task management (P1), task modification (P2), and application lifecycle (P3)
- 12 functional requirements covering all specified features
- Key entities: Task, TaskManager, and ConsoleInterface
- 6 measurable success criteria

The specification follows the template structure and ensures each user story is independently testable while maintaining the spec-driven development approach.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Phase I specification established with clear requirements for console-based todo app
- 🧪 Tests: No tests required for specification creation
- 📁 Files: specs/phase1-console-todo/spec.md created with complete feature specification
- 🔁 Next prompts: Next step is to create the implementation plan using /sp.plan
- 🧠 Reflection: Specification properly structured with prioritized user stories and measurable outcomes

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - Specification complete with all required sections
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin implementation planning phase
